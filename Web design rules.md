## Single Column Layout:
Design your desktop layout to naturally stack into a single column.
Use full-width containers that will work on both desktop and mobile.

## Fluid Widths:
Use percentage-based or flexible widths for all elements.
Avoid fixed pixel widths that might cause horizontal scrolling on mobile.

## Flexible Typography:
Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes instead of fixed pixel sizes.
This allows text to scale naturally across different screen sizes.

## Touchable Elements:
Make all interactive elements (buttons, links) large enough to be easily tapped on mobile.
A minimum size of 44x44 pixels for touch targets is a good rule of thumb.

## Flexible Images and Media:
Ensure all images and media are set to scale with their containers.
Use max-width: 100% and height: auto for images.

## Minimize Fixed Heights:
Use min-height where necessary, but generally allow elements to grow with content.

## Simple Navigation:
Keep navigation simple and linear, avoiding complex multi-level structures.

## Viewport Meta Tag:
Include <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> in your HTML.

## Use CSS Flexbox or Grid:
These layout methods naturally adapt to different screen sizes.

## Generous Spacing:
Use consistent and generous spacing that works well on both desktop and mobile.

## Avoid Hover-Dependent Interactions:
Ensure all functionality is accessible without relying on hover states.

## Scrollable Containers:
Allow long content areas to scroll vertically rather than trying to fit everything on one screen.
