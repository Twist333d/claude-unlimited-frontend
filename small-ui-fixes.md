- Hide the sidebar completely (make it hidden) unless it's open on mobile
- how usage stats are calculated right now? They should be calculated globally for each user.

- the text input on mobile is below the URL bar on Safari. Can I make it always sticky at the bottom area? How would this impact the desktop?


For each of the changes, before writing a single line of code, please do scoping:
- what needs to change
- where, what files, what lines
- consider edge cases

Then provide step by step guide for each point so that I can implement -> test -> continue
