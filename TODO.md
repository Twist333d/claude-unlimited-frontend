- Re-factor conversation starting. I don't understand why do I have a separate route even - DONE
- It potentially should be as simple as:
  - either sending a message to a new chat on load
  - sending a message to a new chat after clicking the button
  - should have the same flow for creation
  - the button should just clear the messages (load a new page so-to-speak) 
- Fix the tests, and re-test everything - DONE
- Fix cypress tests
